Mtime has platform independent support for monotonic wall-clock time.
This time increases monotonically and is not subject to operating
system calendar time adjustments. The library has types to represent
nanosecond precision timestamps and time spans.

{!Mtime_clock} provides acces to {{!Mtime_clock.platform_support}a
monotonic system clock} and its resolution (if available).
