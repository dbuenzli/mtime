(** Monotonic time values.

    [Mtime] has platform independent support for monotonic wall-clock
    time. This time increases monotonically and is not subject to
    operating system calendar time adjustments.

    {{!spans}Time spans} represent non-negative monotonic time spans
    between two monotonic clock readings. {{!timestamps}Timestamps}
    represent system-relative monotonic {e timestamps}, their absolute
    value is meaningless but they can be compared across the processes
    of an operating system run.

    {!Mtime_clock} provides access to a system monotonic clock.

type span
(** The type for non-negative monotonic time spans. They represent the
    difference between two monotonic clock readings. If the platform's
    clock has nanosecond resolution the representation guarantees that
    the function {!Mtime_clock.elapsed} can measure up to
    approximatively 584 Julian year spans before silently rolling over
    (unlikely since this is in a single program run). *)

(** {1:convert Time scale conversion}

    The following convenience constants relate time scales to seconds.
    Used as multiplicands they can be used to convert these units
    to and from seconds.

    The constants are defined according to
    {{:http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html}SI
    prefixes} on seconds and
    {{:http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/table6.html}accepted
    non-SI units}. Years are counted in Julian years (365.25 SI-accepted days)
    as {{:http://www.iau.org/publications/proceedings_rules/units/}defined}
    by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). *)
