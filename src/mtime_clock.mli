(** Monotonic time clock.

    [Mtime_clock] provides access to a system monotonic clock. This
    time increases monotonically and is not subject to operating
    system calendar time adjustments.

    Only use {!Mtime_clock.now} if you need inter-process time
    correlation, otherwise prefer {!Mtime_clock.elapsed} and
    {{!Mtime_clock.counters}counters}.

    Consult important information about {{!err}error handling}
    and {{!platform_support}platform support}.

    Concrete implementation of this interfaces are provided by the
    [mtime.clock.os] and [mtime.clock.jsoo] packages against which you
    should compile depending on your target.

(** {1:clock Monotonic clock} *)

val elapsed : unit -> Mtime.span
(** [elapsed ()] is the monotonic time span elapsed since the
    beginning of the program.

    @raise Sys_error see {{!err}error handling} *)

val now : unit -> Mtime.t
(** [now ()] is the current system-relative monotonic timestamp. Its
    absolute value is meaningless.

    @raise Sys_error see {{!err}error handling} *)

val period : unit -> Mtime.span option
(** [period ()] is the clock's period as a monotonic time span (if
    available). *)

(** {1:counters Time counters} *)

type counter
(** The type for monotonic wall-clock time counters. *)

val counter : unit -> counter
(** [counter ()] is a counter counting from now on.

    @raise Sys_error see {{!err}error handling} *)

val count : counter -> Mtime.span
(** [count c] is the monotonic time span elapsed since [c] was created. *)

(** {1:raw Monotonic clock raw interface} *)

val elapsed_ns : unit -> int64
(** [elapsed_ns ()] is the {e unsigned} 64-bit integer nanosecond monotonic
     time span elapsed since the beginning of the program.

    @raise Sys_error see {{!err}error handling} *)

val now_ns : unit -> int64
(** [now_ns ()] is an {e unsigned} 64-bit integer nanosecond
     system-relative monotonic timestamp. The absolute value is
     meaningless.

    @raise Sys_error see {{!err}error handling} *)

val period_ns : unit -> int64 option
(** [period_ns ()] is the clock's period as an {e unsigned} 64-bit
    integer nanosecond monotonic time span (if available). *)

(** {1:err Error handling}

    The functions {!elapsed}, {!now}, {!counter}, {!elapsed_ns} and
    {!now_ns} raise [Sys_error] whenever they can't determine the
    current time or that it doesn't fit in [Mtime]'s range. Usually
    this exception should only be catched at the toplevel of your
    program to log it and abort the program. It indicates a serious
    error condition in the system.

    All the other functions, whose functionality is less essential,
    simply silently return [None] if they can't determine the
    information either because it is unavailable or because an error
    occured.
