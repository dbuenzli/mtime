(** Monotonic wall-clock time.

    [Mtime] provides access to monotonic wall-clock time. This time
    increases monotonically and is not subject to operating system
    calendar time adjustments. Its absolute value has no meaning and
    is not exposed. It can only be used to measure wall-clock time
    spans in a single program run.

    Time resolution should be nanoseconds but can be less, consult the
    {{!platform}platform support} for more information.

(** {1 Availability} *)

val available : bool
(** [available] is [true] iff monotonic wall-clock time is available. If
    [available] is [false] time spans always return zero. *)

(** {1 Time spans} *)

type span
(** The type for non-negative time spans.

    Span values cannot be constructed directly they represent the
    difference between two monotonic wall-clock time samples.

    If the platform has nanosecond resolution the size of the data
    type guarantees it can measure up to a approximatively 584 Julian
    year spans before (silently) rolling over; but remember this is in
    a single program run. *)

(** {1 Passing time} *)

val elapsed : unit -> span
(** [elapsed ()] is the wall-clock time span elapsed since the
    beginning of the program. *)

(** {1 Time counters} *)

(** The type for monotonic wall-clock time counters. *)

val counter : unit -> counter
(** [counter ()] is a counter counting time from now on. *)

val count : counter -> span

    [c] was created. *)

val to_year : span -> float
(** [to_year span] is [span] in Julian years (365.25 days, 31'557'600s). *)

val to_ns_uint64 : span -> int64
(** [to_ns_uint64] is [span] in nanoseconds as an {e unsigned} 64-bit
    integer. *)

(** {1:convert Time scale conversion}

    The following convenience constants relate time scales to seconds.
    Used as multiplicands they can be used to convert these units
    to and from seconds.

    The constants are defined according to
    {{:http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html}SI
    prefixes} on seconds and
    {{:http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/table6.html}accepted
    non-SI units}. Years are counted in Julian years (365.25 SI-accepted days)
    as {{:http://www.iau.org/publications/proceedings_rules/units/}defined}
    by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). *)

val ns_to_s : float
(** [ns_to_s] is [1e-9] the number of seconds in one nanosecond. *)

val us_to_s : float
(** [us_to_s] is [1e-6], the number of seconds in one microsecond. *)

val ms_to_s : float
(** [ms_to_s] is [1e-3], the number of seconds in one millisecond. *)

val min_to_s : float
(** [min_to_s] is [60.], the number of seconds in one SI-accepted minute. *)

val hour_to_s : float
(** [hour_to_s] is [3600.], the number of seconds in one SI-accepted hour. *)

val day_to_s : float
(** [day_to_s] is [86_400.], the number of seconds in one SI-accepted day. *)

    one second.  *)

val s_to_hour : float
(** [s_to_hour] is [1. /. 3600.], the number of SI-accepted hours in
    one second. *)

(** [s_to_year] is [1. /. 31_557_600.], the number of Julian years
    in one second. *)

(** {1:print Printing} *)

val pp_span : Format.formatter -> span -> unit
(** [pp_span ppf span] prints an unspecified representation of
    [span] on [ppf]. The representation is not fixed-width,
    depends on the magnitude of [span] and uses locale
    independent {{!convert}standard time scale} abbreviations. *)

val pp_span_s : Format.formatter -> float -> unit
(** [pp_span_s] prints like {!pp_span} does but on a seconds floating
    point time span value (which can be negative). *)

(** {1:platform Platform support}
