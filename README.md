-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release %%VERSION%%

Mtime is an OCaml module to access monotonic wall-clock time. It

calendar time adjustments.

Mtime depends only on your platform system library. The optional
JavaScript support depends on [js_of_ocaml][1]. It is distributed

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][5]
and there is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the

## Sample programs

If you installed Mtime with `opam` sample programs are located in
the directory `opam config var mtime:doc`.

In the distribution sample programs are located in the `test`
directory of the distribution. They can be built with:

    ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind test/tests.otarget

The resulting binaries are in `_build/test`.

- `test.native` tests the library, nothing should fail.
