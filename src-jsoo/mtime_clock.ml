(* Conversion of DOMHighResTimeStamp to uint64 nanosecond timestamps.

   The spec https://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time-3 says DOMHighResTimeStamp
   are double milliseconds that *should* be accurate to 5 microseconds.
   We simply assume we have microsecond precision and multiply the
   stamps given by performance.now () by 1e3 to get double microseconds.

   We then use Int64.of_float on these double microseconds to get an
   uint64 in microseconds. This works in practice for the following
   reasons. Let us assume we have the largest integer microsecond
   timestamp representable exactly in double, i.e. 2^53 :

   1) Assuming the zero of performance.now is when the tab is created,
      our 2^53 timestamp only occurs after:

        2^53 / 1_000_000 / (24 * 3600 * 365.25) ≅ 285.4 Julian years

   2) 2^53 < Int64.max_int = 2^63 - 1, so seing the result of
      Int64.of_float as unsigned for this timestamp is correct and in
      the defined domain of the conversion function (the truncated float
      must lie in [Int64.min_int;Int64.max_int] for defined behaviour).

   So the Int64.of_float conversion is unlikely to be problematic and
   we simply bring the resulting uint64 microsecond to an uint64
   nanosecond by multiplying by 1000L, which for 2^53 microseconds
   remains smaller than Int64.max_int, yielding a correct uint64
   nanosecond timestamp for a reasonable time range. *)

(* Raw interface *)

let now_us () = performance_now_ms () *. 1e3

let start_us = now_us ()
let elapsed_ns () = Int64.(mul (of_float @@ now_us () -. start_us) us_to_ns)
let now_ns () = Int64.(mul (of_float @@ now_us ()) us_to_ns)
let period_ns () = None

(* Monotonic clock *)

let elapsed () = Mtime.Span.of_uint64_ns (elapsed_ns ())
let now () = Mtime.of_uint64_ns (now_ns ())
let period () = Mtime.Span.unsafe_of_uint64_ns_option (period_ns ())

(* Counters *)

type counter = float
let counter = now_us
let count c =
  Mtime.Span.of_uint64_ns (Int64.(mul (of_float  @@ now_us () -. c)) us_to_ns)
